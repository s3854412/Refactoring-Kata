# Refactoring Katas

Can you refactor? In really small steps? Can you turn some, frankly, ugly code into a paradigm of elegant, readable, extensible design?

This is a collection of starting files for when practicing refactoring.

Contents so far:

- Tennis Kata in Java.
- Gilded Rose Kata in Java

- Yahtzee Kata in Java.

For more information about these and other katas, you may be interested in my book [The Coding Dojo Handbook](http://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook)
